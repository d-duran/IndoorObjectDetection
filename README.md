# IndoorObjectDetection

Welcome to this repository for object detection using the Indoor Object Detection Dataset by Adhikari and Bishwo. This repository contains a Colab notebook that demonstrates how to train an object detector using the dataset.

## Dataset

The [Indoor Object Detection Dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/2654485#.Y9FTiRXMJD9) by Adhikari and Bishwo contains images of indoor scenes with labeled objects. The dataset includes a total of 7 classes of objects and 2213 images.

## Requirements

Google Colab
TensorFlow 2.x
Python 3

## Installation

Clone this repository: 
```git clone https://github.com/d-duran/IndoorObjectDetection.git```

Open the Colab notebook: `indoor_object_detection.ipynb`

Run the notebook

## Usage

The Colab notebook contains all the code necessary to train and evaluate an object detector using the Indoor Object Detection Dataset. The notebook also includes instructions on how to use the trained model to detect objects in new images.

## Results

The object detector is able to achieve good performance on the test set of the Indoor Object Detection Dataset. The model can be used for various indoor object detection applications.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank Adhikari and Bishwo for providing this dataset.
